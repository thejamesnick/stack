# Stack
**"Save. Stack. Repeat."**

Stack is a smart, easy-to-use mini-app designed to help you build consistent savings habits while keeping full control of your money. With Stack, you can choose an amount to save and select how often you want it to be pulled from your wallet—daily, weekly, or monthly. Your funds are automatically secured in a smart contract until your stacking goal is complete, so you can save without thinking about it.

## Key Features

- **Automated Savings**: Flexibly customize your savings plan (Daily, Weekly, Monthly) to fit your lifestyle.
- **Smart Contract Security**: No manual transfers—your plan runs automatically and funds are secured on-chain.
- **Flexible Early Exit**: Full control with a small fee for early withdrawals, encouraging discipline while maintaining liquidity.
- **Future-Proof Yield**: Plans to integrate optional DeFi strategies to make your money work harder for you.
- **Minimal Design**: A simple interface focused on saving, removing decision fatigue.

## How It Works

1.  **Set Your Stack**: Choose the amount, frequency, and duration for your savings goal.
2.  **Automated Pulls**: Stack automatically transfers funds from your wallet into a secure smart contract.
3.  **Goal Completion**: At the end of your stacking period, withdraw your total savings.
4.  **Early Exit**: Need funds now? Break your stack early for a small, transparent fee.

-   **About/**: Project documentation, concept briefs, and resources.

## Getting Started

To get the application running locally:

1.  Navigate to the application directory:
    ```bash
    cd miniapp
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```



4.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
